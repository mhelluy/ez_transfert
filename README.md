## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3** installed on your computer.

### 1. Setup

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the provided Python code into a file named `ez_transfert.py` (or any other `.py` extension).
2.  **Create Directories:**
    * In the **same directory** as your `ez_transfert.py` script, create a new folder named `share`. This is where you'll put files you want to make accessible for download.
    * The script will automatically create a `transferts` folder in your user's home directory (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUser\transferts` on Windows, `/home/youruser/transferts` on Linux) where uploaded files will be saved.

    Your directory structure should look something like this:

    ```
    your_project_folder/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ez_transfert.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ share/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your_photo.jpg
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your_document.pdf
    ```

### 2. Run the Server

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you saved `ez_transfert.py`:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your_project_folder
    ```

3.  Run the script:

    ```bash
    python ez_transfert.py
    ```

    You'll see output similar to this:

    ```
    Les fichiers upload√©s seront sauvegard√©s dans : /home/youruser/transferts
    Les fichiers √† partager seront servis depuis : /path/to/your_project_folder/share
    Serveur HTTP d√©marr√© sur [http://192.168.1.](http://192.168.1.)XX:8000
    Acc√©dez √† [http://192.168.1.](http://192.168.1.)XX:8000/upload depuis votre t√©l√©phone pour uploader des fichiers.
    Acc√©dez √† [http://192.168.1.](http://192.168.1.)XX:8000/get depuis votre t√©l√©phone pour acc√©der aux fichiers partag√©s.
    Toutes les autres requ√™tes GET seront redirig√©es vers /upload.
    Appuyez sur Ctrl+C pour arr√™ter le serveur.
    ```

    Take note of the **IP address** (e.g., `192.168.1.XX`) and the **port** (e.g., `8000`).

### 3. Access from Your Phone

1.  **Connect to Same Network:** Ensure your phone is connected to the **same Wi-Fi network** as your computer.
2.  **Open Browser:** On your phone's web browser, enter one of the following URLs:

    * **For Uploads:**
        `http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:8000/upload`
        (e.g., `http://192.168.1.XX:8000/upload`)
        Here, you can select one or multiple files and upload them to your computer.

    * **For Downloads/Shared Files:**
        `http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:8000/get`
        (e.g., `http://192.168.1.XX:8000/get`)
        This will display a browsable list of files and folders within your `share` directory. Click on files to download them, or click on folders to navigate into them.

### 4. Stop the Server

* In your terminal, press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.
